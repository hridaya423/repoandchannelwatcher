# GH Repo & YT channel watcher

Made for Hack Club's Neon YSWS.  

## What does it do?

This board shows the current subs & views for a selected YT channel, and it shows the stars and forks for a selected repo

To use, change the constants with real data:
```bash
YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID = "CHANNEL_ID"
YOUTUBE_API_KEY = "API_KEY"
GITHUB_USER = "GITHUB_USERNAME"
GITHUB_REPO = "GITHUB_REPO"
GITHUB_TOKEN = "GITHUB_TOKEN"
```
